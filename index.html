			<h3>What to wear</h3>
			<p>This is a water sport and you will definitely get wet, especially as we learn to keep time together. Splashing happens! Quick-drying clothing that you can easily move in is recommended. Some people go barefoot, others wear aquasox, some wear sneakers, sandals, or anything in between. And since it’s Portland in the springtime, you can expect any kind of weather, including rain, hail, thunder & lightning, high wind, and full sun. Wear comfortable layers. </p>

			<h3>Purchasing your own gear</h3>
			<p>Life jackets and paddles are supplied for practices and races, but you might want your own. No personal gear is required. There are lockers to put personal items in, but sometimes teams don’t lock them right. </p>

			<h3>Things you might want to buy are:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Life jacket (PFD) - you can get these lots of places, but it must not be inflatable.</li>
				<li>Paddle - see below for more info.</li>
				<li>Dry bag - large for lots of stuff or small for your cell phone, keys, and wallet. Amazon has a large selection of these types of things. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>Next Adventure and Portland Kayak sell paddles and PFDs and they sometimes offer a discount to dragon boaters for related gear. The practice paddles we use are sized like this: blue 48"; blue/white 50"; white 52"; non-taped paddles 54". Shorter paddles are better for new paddlers. Paddles are $75 at Next Adventure and $72 at Portland Kayak.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://nextadventure.net/portland-paddle-sports-center.html">https://nextadventure.net/portland-paddle-sports-center.html</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://portlandkayak.com/shop-2/">https://portlandkayak.com/shop-2/</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>Bi-mart usually has pretty reasonably-priced PFDs. </p>

			<h3>Dues</h3>
			<p>Registration fees are $70.</p>

			<p>If you’re a new tiller (required) or new paddler (optional, but recommended), you can attend the $15 clinic on Friday, March 30 and Saturday, March 31. Here’s the form to sign up. </p>

			<p>Other possible expenses include some optional gear ($15 - $200), parking during practice, a possible team dinner the week before races, a team t-shirt (about $20), and food for race days.</p>
